		<h2>Happy Ramadan</h2>
		<p>Ramadan (Arabic. رمضان [ra.ma.dˤaːn]) or Ramazan (Tur. Ramazan [ɾɑmɑˈzɑn]) is a month of obligatory for Muslims fasting (sawm) is one of the five pillars of Islam. During the month of Ramadan, devout Muslims refuse to eat, drink, smoke, or engage in sexual activity during the daytime. The duration of the month is 30 days and depends on the lunar calendar (see the Islamic calendar). Fasting begins at the beginning of dawn (after the morning azan) and ends after sunset (after the evening azan).</p>

		<h2>Tarawih</h2>
		<p>
			Tarawih (Arabic: a break, rest, respite — is a voluntary prayer that is performed after the obligatory night prayer (Isha) and lasts until dawn. The Tarawih prayer is performed both individually and collectively. The word "tarawih "is the plural of the Arabic word" tarvikha", which means"rest" in Russian. The prayer is so called because after each of its four rakaats, the worshippers sit down and rest, praising the Lord or listening to the edification of the Imam[8].</p>
		<!--<p><br>
            In the time of the Prophet Muhammad, tarawih consisted of 8 and 20 raqaats, but tarawih, consisting of twenty raqaats, was finally approved by the Caliph Umar with the consent of the Sahabas. According to 4 Sunni madhhabs, the Tarawih prayer is performed in 20 raqaats (10 prayers of 2 raqaats). It is performed every day during the entire month of Ramadan after the night prayer (isha). During the time of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad, after every four raqaats, a short break was made, during which the praise and remembrance of Allah was performed or a short sermon was read.[source not specified 1361 days].
